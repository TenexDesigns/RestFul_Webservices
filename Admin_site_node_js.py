Based on the context, you can create an admin site in Node.js and Express using AdminBro (now called AdminJS) blog.
logrocket.com. Heres a code sample to set up a simple admin panel using AdminJS with Express and MongoDB:


nstall the necessary packages:
npm init
npm i adminjs express tslib express-formidable express-session @adminjs/express @adminjs/mongoose mongoose




Create a file named app.js and add the following code to set up the admin panel:
const AdminJS = require('adminjs')
const AdminJSExpress = require('@adminjs/express')
const AdminJSMongoose = require('@adminjs/mongoose')
const express = require('express')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

// Replace this with your MongoDB connection string
const MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/adminjs-example'

// Register the Mongoose adapter
AdminJS.registerAdapter(AdminJSMongoose)

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect(MONGODB_URI, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
})

// Define a sample schema for demonstration
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  role: { type: String, enum: ['admin', 'user'], required: true }
})
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema)

// Set up AdminJS
const admin = new AdminJS({
  resources: [
    { resource: User }
  ],
  rootPath: '/admin',
})

// Set up the Express app and AdminJS router
const app = express()
const adminRouter = AdminJSExpress.buildAuthenticatedRouter(admin, {
  authenticate: async (email, password) => {
    const user = await User.findOne({ email })
    if (user && user.password === password && user.role === 'admin') {
      return user
    }
    return false
  },
  cookiePassword: 'some-secret-password-used-to-secure-cookie',
})

app.use(admin.options.rootPath, adminRouter)
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening on port 3000'))




This code sets up a simple admin panel with user authentication. Replace MONGODB_URI with your MongoDB connection string. 
The example uses a simple user schema with an email, password, and role.
The authenticate function checks if the user is an admin before granting access to the admin panel.

Run the application with node app.js, and access the admin panel at http://localhost:3000/admin.








To implement an admin panel in Node.js with Express, you could follow these steps:

Refactor your code to make it more maintainable and modular stackoverflow.com.

Use middleware to protect your admin routes with an API key stackoverflow.com.

Create API routes for your admin panel, such as displaying users
data, searching for a user by ID, updating a users data, and deleting a user simplilearn.com.

Set up a new project with AdminJS, a full-stack Node.js application with Express.js and MongoDB. 
This will allow you to build your admin panel with user authentication and manage your content securely blog.logrocket.com.

In summary, you have multiple options for creating an admin site for your Node.js Express application, 
each with its tradeoffs. Depending on your requirements and resources, you can choose the approach that best fits your needs.

how to creeate an admin site for node js express
ANSWER
To create an admin site for your Node.js Express application, you have several options:

Build your admin panel from scratch. This option provides maximum flexibility, but it can be time-consuming,
and you may spend significant time building and maintaining internal tools blog.forestadmin.com.

Use an open-source admin framework or library. This approach is quicker and easier than building from scratch,
but it may come with limitations, especially if non-technical team members need to make edits blog.forestadmin.com.

Use an admin panel template. This option is suitable for simple dashboards or CRMs,
but it might have more limitations compared to open-source frameworks blog.forestadmin.com.

Use a low-code solution. Forest Admin, for example, is a low-code solution that provides an out-of-the-box solution,
allowing you to code custom features with Smart Actions and Smart Views, and includes dedicated support and security blog.forestadmin.com.
