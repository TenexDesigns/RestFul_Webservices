MODELS

-Models represent collections in Mongo Db
-Imagine we have a collections of users, we would create a model to represnet that collection of users and that model would be callled the user model.
In the above case we would have a user model to represent a collection of users


A collection is like a table in sql . It represent a series of data.


Models work hand in hand with schemas

Schemas define the structure of our data objects in our collection.

e.g

{
  name:String,
  rank:String,
  availability:Boolean
  


}


THEN WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL MOOONGOOSE

Mongoose add a layer of methods to eaily save ,edit ,retrieve and delete data from mongodg
Mongoose allows us to create our models and schemas easily.
We install mongoose in our project usin gnpm.
